# HRLDAS/Noah-MP code used in _Implementing deep soil and dynamic root uptake in Noah-MP (v4.5): Impact on Amazon dry-season transpiration_ (2025)

There are three branches in this repository, each with different versions of HRLDAS/Noah-MP.

- **DynaRoot:** Version of HRLDAS/Noah-MP with a dynamic root water uptake scheme implemented ([Fan et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1712381114)). This version was used for the SOIL and ROOT experiments described in the publication.
- **release-v4.5-WRF**: This is the release of HRLDAS/Noah-MP which served as the basis for our simulations and model development. It is also the version used for the GW experiment described in the publication.
- **fd:** Version of HRLDAS/Noah-MP with free drainage configuration. This version was used for the FD (control) experiment described in the publication.

Information on downloading, compiling, and running HRLDAS/Noah-MP can be found at https://github.com/NCAR/hrldas. Questions about the code in this repository can be directed to Carolina Bieri (cab478@ucar.edu).
